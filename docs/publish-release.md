# Publish release

1. Update the latest version in the readme and push it.
2. Go to <https://github.com/sanosdole/nodeclrhost/releases> and select `Draft a new release`.
3. Use the version prefixed with `v` as tag name _and_ release name. E.g. `v0.1.0-alpha.11`.
4. Done. GitHub CI will publish the release and upload artifacts to GitHub :)
