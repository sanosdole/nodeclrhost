# NodeHostEnvironment

This project enables writing node/electron applications with .NET.
This is achieved by a native node module (`coreclr-hosting`) that runs a .NET application.
The .NET application uses the `NodeHostEnvironment` library to interact with the node runtime.

See <https://github.com/sanosdole/nodeclrhost> for documentation.
